A simple library to provide Roslyn analyzers to show how to deal with technical debt. **Note:** The anaylsis rules here are subjective and based upon things we encounter when maintaining a sizable codebase.

## Mission Statement
* Provide a simple library of code warnings around method usage that can impact maintainability or performance of code.
* Build of top of common functionality from Code Cracker to keep development simple.
* Keep the project small and simple so won't require much ongoing maintenance, and possibly allow for code to be pushed to respective projects if it would prove fruitful.
